# Anomaly-Detection-on-Financial-data-using-Autoencoder-Techniques
Overview

This project focuses on anomaly detection using autoencoders, a type of neural network designed for unsupervised learning. The autoencoder is trained on normal data to learn its patterns and reconstruct them. Any significant deviation in reconstruction error is identified as an anomaly.

Features

Uses deep learning-based autoencoders for anomaly detection.

Learns normal data patterns and identifies deviations as anomalies.

Implements data preprocessing and visualization.

Supports different datasets for training and evaluation.

Built using Python and deep learning libraries.
